1) where to put info about installed pip requirements?
  requirements.txt and then Makefile?
    ##Makefile##
        init:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

        test:
            py.test tests

        .PHONY: init test
2) How to properly structure main file vs def files
    1 def per file? is this silly?
3) How to keep from duplicating import requests...
4) config.py in gitignore and contains auth stuffs?
